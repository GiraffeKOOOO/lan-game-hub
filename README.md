# lan-game-hub
A simple web app to help manage game organisation at a LAN party.
This web app allows users to view the games scheduled for a LAN event in a list or a timeline view, join games, view how many people are interested in playing games, add or remove games to the schedule, view tournament brackets and more.
This application is written in React, coz god forbid I use anything else.

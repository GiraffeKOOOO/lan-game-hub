## What does this web app do?
This web app allows users to: 
- view the games scheduled for a LAN event in a list or a timeline view
- view how many people are interested in playing games
- join games
- add or remove games to the schedule
- view tournament brackets 
- and more.
<p>This application is written in React, because god forbid I use anything else.</p>
<p>This app is also 100% just a re-write of my previous game manager that I attempted to write in PHP but got too busy, and I figured it's easier to just forget the other version exists, and restart this project in React.</p>
